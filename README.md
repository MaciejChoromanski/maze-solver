## Images restrictions

This script solves mazes from images. The method used to determine where the exit is relies on always sticking with the right wall of the maze. The width and the height of the image doesn't matter. However, the image must contain only 3 colors:

1. Grey - this one represents entrance and exit of the maze,
2. Black - this one represents the walls of the maze,
3. White - this one represents the walking space of the maze.

Additional info:
1. The entrance of the maze must be located at (0, 0) pixel.
2. The exit of the maze must be located at (<max_width>, <max_height>) pixel.
